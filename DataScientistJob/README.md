# Would you become a data scientist?  
# Let's explore skills required and salary expectations from some job listings!

## by Mariangela Bonghi

This is the first project for the "Data Scientist" [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com) Nanodegree where I analyzed a dataset that contains more than 3900 job listing for data scientist positions.

## Description

I have found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/data-scientist-jobs) a very interesting dataset created by [picklesueat](https://github.com/picklesueat/data_jobs_data) that contains more than 3900 job listing for data scientist positions, with features such as:

- Salary Estimate
- Location
- Company Rating
- Job Description
- and more.  

The data were collected around 7/8/2020

The investigation of the dataset will be focused on the following points:
- What are the most required skills?
- What are the locations with the higher demands for data scientist?
- What are the industries with the higher demands for data scientists?
- What is the salary expectation?
